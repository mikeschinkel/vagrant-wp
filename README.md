# WordPress on Vagrant+Bash Script from Scratch
 
##DO NOT USE* 
Instead, use [WPLib Box](/wplib/wplib-box) which is 1000% better and also supported!
 
----
This project is a proof of concept for building a Vagrant box.  

It was as much a learning exercise as anything, but I am keeping it around in case I want to reference it.
